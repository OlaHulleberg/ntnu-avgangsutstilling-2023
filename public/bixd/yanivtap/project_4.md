What if Ambulance communication systems could be more precise in diagnosis through the use of innovative design and tech?

Project PreVis is the answer to that question. The Norwegian Ambulance system and HDO has in the past few years been cooperating with new and innovative tech which alleviates the tasks of paramedics in the field by helping them communicate effectively with specialists in hospitals.

My role in this project was to oversee the UI and plan out the digital user experience in combination with the insight that we produced over the course of the project.
