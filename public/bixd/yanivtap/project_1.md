This bachelor thesis investigates the design of public digital services within the context of a national designsystem and how it can serve as a tool for municipalities in order to provide consistent and user-friendly interfaces. The group was tasked by the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency as a final interaction design project at the Department of Design within the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Gjøvik. The task was initiated due to the fragmented user experience amongst public digital services such as NAV, UDI and Altinn which were the services researched - an issue both the team and our users experienced across various periods of life.

The project team compiled an insight repository through a myriad of insight and research methods. We summarized that our user groups, both fluent and non-fluent Norwegian speakers, experience information overload and are confused by the inconsistent design patterns presented towards them in modern public digital services. This was especially prevalent when users go through forms. In this report, we will be presenting in detail the project team’s hybrid solution consisting of guidelines and prototypes where the group had looked to game design as an inspiration.
