Mustad Campus is rather unique in the fact that it has no group rooms so students mostly rely on the main rooms as a place to work. This has posed a challenge for students and staff alike when it comes to knowing if a classroom is available. This was due to that the display screens used also displayed ads that took up the whole space which made finding out their schedule irritating and the main function of the screen partially relegated.

This project entails how my group devised a solution to a new interface for these displays screens throughout campus through the use of XR-Tech and RFID card readers.

My role in the group was to draft the majority of the working parts of information architecture, from RFID readers to how the XR technology interacts with the system. I also had a hand in prototyping and testing the interace of the prototype.

Eventually the solutions was tested and iterated with a Figma prototype with an introduction of scalable scalable timetables presented on a vertical screen for each of the main rooms in our campus.
