bio: "Hiya! I'm Yaniv-Tamer Pries - interaction, graphic and motion designer and specialize primarily in human-machine interaction and information architecture for both digital and hybrid solutions. I'm always curious and enthusiastic to create ideas and solutions with a hint of rationale and experimentation.

I believe that design shouldn’t just also be a treat for the eyes, but also one that can serve people of many walks of life. While i do want to make sure that i can translate a brief and clients ideas to their favored medium, I also want it to make more opportunities."

project_desc_1: "This bachelor thesis investigates the design of public digital services within the context of a national designsystem and how it can serve as a tool for municipalities in order to provide consistent and user-friendly interfaces. The group was tasked by the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency as a final interaction design project at the Department of Design within the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Gjøvik. The task was initiated due to the fragmented user experience amongst public digital services such as NAV, UDI and Altinn which were the services researched - an issue both the team and our users experienced across various periods of life. 

The project team compiled an insight repository through a myriad of insight and research methods. We summarized that our user groups, both fluent and non-fluent Norwegian speakers, experience information overload and are confused by the inconsistent design patterns presented towards them in modern public digital services. This was especially prevalent when users go through forms. In this report, we will be presenting in detail the project team’s hybrid solution consisting of guidelines and prototypes where the group had looked to game design as an inspiration."

project_desc_2: "The urban planning division of Gjøvik Municipality (Byen Vår Gjøvik) tasked us in conceptualizing and redesigning a suggestion to a solution that connects various cultural events and businesses together with their audiences. 

The project involved identifying issues and possibilities amongst our users - primarily concert-goers of various demographics and event organizers whose venues vary in size. Their needs for a new solutions required a complete revamping of the presentation of each event with practical information located in-site and a more user-friendly interface for inputting new and recurring events. 

A solution was provided in the form of a responsive site that caters to event-goers by providing concise details about events happening in the city, a revamped sorting and filtration system and more flexibility when trying to find information"

project_desc_3: "Mustad Campus is rather unique in the fact that it has no group rooms so students mostly rely on the main rooms as a place to work. This has posed a challenge for students and staff alike when it comes to knowing if a classroom is available. This was due to that the display screens used also displayed ads that took up the whole space which made finding out their schedule irritating and the main function of the screen partially relegated.

This project entails how my group devised a solution to a new interface for these displays screens throughout campus through the use of XR-Tech and RFID card readers.

My role in the group was to draft the majority of the working parts of information architecture, from RFID readers to how the XR technology interacts with the system. I also had a hand in prototyping and testing the interace of the prototype.

Eventually the solutions was tested and iterated with a Figma prototype with an introduction of scalable scalable timetables presented on a vertical screen for each of the main rooms in our campus."

project_desc_4: "What if Ambulance communication systems could be more precise in diagnosis through the use of innovative design and tech? 

Project PreVis is the answer to that question. The Norwegian Ambulance system and HDO has in the past few years been cooperating with new and innovative tech which alleviates the tasks of paramedics in the field by helping them communicate effectively with specialists in hospitals.

My role in this project was to oversee the UI and plan out the digital user experience in combination with the insight that we produced over the course of the project."
