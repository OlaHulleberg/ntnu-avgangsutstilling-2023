Hiya! I'm Yaniv-Tamer Pries - interaction, graphic and motion designer and specialize primarily in human-machine interaction and information architecture for both digital and hybrid solutions. I'm always curious and enthusiastic to create ideas and solutions with a hint of rationale and experimentation.

I believe that design shouldnâ€™t just also be a treat for the eyes, but also one that can serve people of many walks of life. While i do want to make sure that i can translate a brief and clients ideas to their favored medium, I also want it to make more opportunities.
