Hei, my name is Yaniv-Tamer Pries, I am designer who focuses on human-machine interaction and information architecture. Oh, and iâ€™ve been dabbling with graphic and motion design since 2017.

Part German and part Filipino, raised in both the Philippines and Norway, my roots stem from a family that has always worked with something technical. My late father introduced me to computers and its hardware when i was younger. I was fascinated by how it worked, especially with interfaces such as the humble keyboard and mouse.
